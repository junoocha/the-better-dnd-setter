	`Fate is for peasants... you have math.`,
	`Behold, the power of planning... and mild anxiety.`,
	`Rolls? No thanks, I brought a calculator.`,
	`Because chaos is scary and control is comforting.`,
	`You didn't roll for stats, you negotiated them.`,
	`The dice gods frown upon you, but the nerd gods nod in approval.`,
	`Custom-built like a luxury cart... with optimized horsepower.`,
	`Finally, a system where intelligence is more than a dump stat.`,
	`You're not building a character, you're crafting an optimized masterpiece.`,
	`Control freak? No, you're just fate-averse.`,
	`Every number has a purpose. Every dump stat, a strategy.`,

	`Precision. Balance. Calculation. And maybe a little madness.`,
	`Point allocation complete. Efficiency: optimal.`,
	`Crafted with care... and a slight obsession with Charisma modifiers.`,

	`Your character sheet has more math than my thesis.`,
	`Congratulations, you min-maxed your personality.`,
	`Ah, yes, power without the panic.`,
	`You walked into a tavern and immediately negotiated.`,
	`Spreadsheets AND swordplay? Iconic.`,

	`Back when I had stats, I maxed out Apathy. Served me well.`,
	`Careful now. That's how the last customer accidentally became a frog.`,
	`Planning a build, are we? Delightful. The monsters will love it.`,
	`Have you considered dumping everything into Vibes? No? Coward.`,
	`Once had a customer pour every point into Intelligence. Now teaches slugs to dance.`,
	`They say every point spent echoes through the void. I say it jingles in my coin jar.`,
	`Oh good, another custom build. Haven't seen that fail spectacularly... this week.`,
	`All these points and still no one invests in common sense.`,
	`You could put points into Strength. Or, hear me out... bribe the monster.`,
	`Some say the perfect build exists. They're buried under the store.`,
	`Making a decision? That's adorable.`,
	`One time someone asked for a refund. Now they live in the mirror.`,
	`I've met paladins with better point spreads. And paladins are allergic to creativity.`,
	`Yes yes, take your time. The rats haven't organized yet.`,
	`I like the way you're thinking. Mostly because it's bad for your survival.`,
	`Keep going. The stat screen likes watching people struggle.`,
	`Go on, overthink it. The spirits are very entertained.`,
	`Reminds me of a monk who dumped Wisdom. He walks into walls now. Philosophically.`,
	`I used to have stats. Then I opened a shop.`,
	`I've seen better builds on a soup spoon.`,
	`If you're still here in 10 minutes, the furniture starts whispering ideas.`,
	`You can respec later, sure. If you survive the paperwork trial.`,

	`This is the part where the fate-weavers usually start cackling.`,
	`You've got that look... the one that says, I read one forum post.`,
	`Careful. If you spend wrong, the stat screen bites.`,
	`Haha I remember an adventurer who couldn't decide... they're still deciding, probably.`,
	`Back in my day, we just picked a number and prayed. None of this fancy thinking business.`,
	`Ah, takes me back. Long nights by candlelight, rerolling dice and regretting everything.`,
	`I remember when points meant something. Now? Just numbers and delusions.`,
	`Last time someone took this long, the dungeon evolved sentience and left.`,
	`You ever just stare at numbers until they start whispering your name? No? Huh.`,
	`This part used to be sacred. Now it's all sliders and shiny buttons. Progress, I guess.`,
	`Had a customer once who closed their eyes and clicked randomly. Legend says they lived. Briefly.`,
	`Y'know, I used to spend points too. Then I spent one on retail management. Curse lasted forever.`,
	`Time was, you'd carve your stats into stone and bleed on them for good luck. Kids these days...`,
	`I can still smell the fire from the last stat allocation gone wrong. Mmm. Smoky ambition.`,
	`Ah yes... this silence. Reminds me of that time the points fought back.`,
	`I used to dream of points. Now I just dream of dust and return policies.`,
	`Careful now. The last one who hesitated this long developed a second conscience.`,
	`Reminds me of that one adventurer who sat right there... just like you... never left.`,
	`There was a time when allocating points was an art. Now it's more of a public hazard.`,
	`Strange, how something so simple can feel like rewriting fate. Or maybe I'm just dramatic.`,
	`Once knew a bard who never finished this step. Haunts the dropdown menus now.`,
	`Had a wizard spend all their points, then immediately try to unlive their decision. Not pretty.`,
	`These quiet moments always get me thinking. And thinking leads to regret. Careful with that.`,
	`Ah, the delicate art of min-maxing. You remind me of a wizard who exploded.`,
	`Take your time, really. It's not like I'm bound to this counter for eternity or anything.`,
	`Back in my day, we didn't have points. We had grit, and tetanus.`,
	`Careful with those points. I saw someone dump it all into charisma and spontaneously combust.`,
	`Balance is key. Or chaos. Either works, I suppose.`,
	`You know, in the end, we're all just poorly-optimized stat blocks.`,
	`I once sold a sword that whispered nightmares. Got excellent reviews.`,
	`Want my advice? Don't ask a guy whose best friend is a talking candle.`,
	`You're doing great. Really. Just don't forget to leave some points for common sense.`,
	`I had a customer once who chose all 8s. Said they wanted the true peasant experience.`,
	`Ah, the thrill of numbers. Riveting stuff. No, seriously, I live for this.`,
	`You ever wonder why Strength costs more than Wisdom? I don't. I just ring it up.`,
	`I once watched someone spend three hours here... then trip over a root in the tutorial zone.`,
	`Just know whatever you pick, fate will find a way to mock you. It always does.`,
	`You're being very methodical. I respect that. Not enough to help, but I respect it.`,
	`I could tell you what the optimal build is... but where's the fun in that?`,
	`You think you're the first one to try a full Dexterity build? Ha. Good luck with wind.`,
	`Every point tells a story. Most of them end with mild regret.`,
	`Don't worry, the stats you pick now only define your entire experience. No pressure.`,
	`Reminds me of the time I tried point buy with a mimic. It didn't go well.`,
	`I'd warn you about overspecializing, but hey, live dangerously.`,
	`Ever allocate points while cursed? You're not, are you? ...Right?`,
	`Try not to stare at the numbers too long. They start whispering back.`,
	`Your hands tremble with power... or indecision. It's hard to tell.`,
	`Yes, yes... touch everything. The shelves love that.`,
	`Ah, a bold choice. Or a foolish one. Hard to tell from this angle.`,
	`You have a good eye... Can I buy it off you?`,
	`You're picking that? Fascinating. It didn't like the last six who did.`,
	`No refunds, no returns, no take-backsies.`,

	`That one's free, but the consequences aren't.`,
	`Oh, you're drawn to that? Hm. The prophecy thickens.`,
	`Why are you still here... Hurry and leave...`,
	`Up and down and up and down... Make a decision already...`,
	`Did you know that I'm fed up with you? Please let me go on break...`,
	`Can you hear the Jerry sing? Singing a song of being sad...`,
	`I'm only here for the next 3000 years...`,
	`I like turtles.`,
	`.......Why you looking at me as if I should say something?`,
	`Maybe don't do that... or do that... I don't know I can't see well...`,
	`Those plushies are off-sale... Yes they're mine...`,
	`I remember when points had weight. Not metaphorically... we had to carry them.`,
	`You ever seen someone dump everything into Constitution and still get winded by a door? I have.`,
	`I had a point once. Lost it in a bet with a particularly smug squirrel.`,
	`Go on, invest in Charisma. You'll die pretty.`,
	`Strength makes you a hero. Intelligence makes you a threat. Both make you a corpse.`,
	`One time someone min-maxed so hard they phased out of the game. Never saw them again.`,
	`The more you hesitate, the more likely the furniture is to offer unsolicited advice.`,
	`That build? Bold. Reckless. Ill-advised. I approve.`,
	`Once knew a druid who dumped Wisdom. Became a shrub. Said it was peaceful.`,
	`You're doing great. Statistically speaking, anyway.`,
	`I've seen goblins with better point spreads. And they eat chalk.`,
	`Back in my day, the shopkeeper mocked us too. It's tradition.`,
	`Allocate fast. The menu grows teeth if left idle.`,
	`The longer you stare, the more persuasive the wrong choice becomes.`,
	`Spend like your life depends on it. Because, well...`,
	`That stat combo again? Alright. Just don't ask me to mop later.`,
	`There's theory, then there's practice, then there's your build. Let's see what happens.`,
	`Cursed item with a side of regret? Or would you prefer a sensible build?`,
	`I once saw a barbarian cry after picking Intelligence. It was beautiful.`,

export const shopKeeperResults = [
	`Well, well. A build with consequences. I respect that.`,
	`Sealed in fate, scribbled in ink, and entirely your problem now.`,
	`Hope you're happy with those choices... because they're very permanent. Probably.`,
	`Mmm. A stat spread only a mother could love.`,
	`Ah, bold and mildly concerning. My favorite combination.`,
	`Locked in? Wonderful. I love the sound of irreversible decisions.`,
	`You done? Good. Now we find out what the universe thinks of you.`,
	`Excellent. Now let's pretend you knew what you were doing.`,
	`Stats confirmed. The prophecy trembles.`,
	`Well, those are numbers. Let's hope they add up to survival.`,
	`Choices made, regrets pending.`,
	`Looks like someone's ready to face destiny... or at least trip into it.`,
	`Ah. Another custom blend of ambition and overconfidence.`,
	`Finalized? Brave. Foolish, maybe, but brave.`,
	`I'll file these under "optimistic". Good luck out there.`,
	`Done already? Huh. Bold speed for a delicate operation.`,
	`Great. Now if you explode later, it's not on me.`,
	`And with that, your fate is caffeinated and ready to go.`,
	`The ink's still wet, but I'm sure it'll hold... mostly.`,
	`A curious arrangement of numbers. I look forward to seeing it fail or flourish.`,
	`The final numbers fall into place... like teeth in a hungry smile.`,
	`Ah, the pattern is complete. I hope it doesn't summon anything.`,
	`And so, the shape of you is written. Odd shape, that.`,
	`Very well. The pact is sealed. No swapsies.`,
	`The tally is done. The stars blink knowingly.`,
	`Choices laid bare... may they carry you farther than they carried me.`,
	`Interesting. The last one who chose this arrangement disappeared. Probably unrelated.`,
	`Hm. Your fate stirs. Or maybe that's the broom again.`,
	`The numbers hum. That's either approval or indigestion.`,
	`It is written. Poorly, but it's written.`,
	`A whisper moves through the shelves... it seems they approve.`,
	`Ah. The ritual is complete. The consequences... not yet.`,
	`Good. I can almost smell the narrative tension.`,
	`You've chosen. The weight of potential presses down like an old quilt.`,
	`Curious spread. The bones agree. Some of them.`,
	`It is done. The runes groan, but they'll manage.`,
	`Your form is fixed... for now. Reality's flexible, but not that flexible.`,
	`I'll archive this under "Experimental". You'll do fine. Probably.`,
	`So be it. The ledger accepts your sum. Let's hope you can carry it.`,
	`I was about to say nice rolls, but you just whipped out a wallet.`,
	`Ah, the sound of coins buying destiny. Truly magical.`,
	`Point by point, your legend is... financially optimized.`,
	`Nothing says heroic journey like careful budgeting.`,
	`Well, that's one way to build character. Literally.`,
	`Buying power? Bold. Capitalism always wins.`,
	`Just once, I'd like someone to embrace chaos. But nooo, balance.`,
	`And with that, your build is complete. Receipts available upon request.`,
	`Optimized and monetized. You'll go far, probably too far.`,
	`Mm. Efficient. Uninspired. But efficient.`,
	`A solid build. Would've preferred a little drama, but fine.`,
	`All wrapped up. Now leave a review... or a tip.`,
	`Mind leaving five stars and a blood offering? Or just the stars?`,
	`If you're satisfied with your stats, please scream loudly into the mirror. It's how we count reviews.`,
	`Thanks for shopping Jerry's Soul Forge & Stat Emporium. No refunds.`,
	`Was it everything you dreamed? Please rate your regret on a scale of 1 to 6.`,
	`Enjoy your stats. I'll be muttering about them for the next hour regardless.`,
	`All done? Don't forget to tell your friends about Jerry. Or don't. It's quieter that way.`,
	`Glad I could help shape your fate. If anything explodes, it wasn't me.`,
	`I've seen worse. And I've sold worse. So you're in good shape.`,
	`...Are we done? Great. I'm going back to sleep now.`,
	`Cool. Stats set. Please don't need anything else.`,
	`Wonderful. Now I can resume my eternal nap.`,
	`Another hero forged, another nap delayed.`,
	`Finally. Do you know how hard it is to yawn silently?`,
	`Okay, you're done. Now leave me to my lukewarm tea and existential dread.`,
	`Finished? Great. Wake me when destiny collapses.`,
	`Ah, the thrill of paperwork and point allocation. Riveting.`,
	`Let me know if you need anything. Actually, don't.`,
	`Cool, cool... I'll just be lying face-down behind the counter now.`,
	`Another masterpiece built... with math. Fascinating.`,
	`You're all set. I'm going to stare into the wall for a bit.`,
	`Great build. Truly. I'm weeping with joy on the inside.`,
	`Your stats are fine. Can I go back to pretending to dust things now?`,
	`Ah yes, the joy of customer service. Please leave me alone.`,
	`Alright, destiny is officially priced and packaged. I need a nap.`,
	`You're done? Good. I've got 37 more years of slouching to catch up on.`,
	`Thank you for choosing Jerry's. Now please stop choosing Jerry's.`,
	`And with that... I drift back into the void of minor apathy.`,
	`Another adventurer walks out... and I remain. Forever. Here.`,
